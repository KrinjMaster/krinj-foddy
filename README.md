# Rusty Invaders [WIP]

For those who will run it:

1. You should install cargo cli.
2. You can run the game by cloning the repo and running ```cargo run```.
3. You can modify game setting at 'src/main.rs' in the very beginning of the file. Some of the features are not finished, such as audio (only firing sounds are present), game stats and menu (not there at all)

Controls:
WASD - Move your ship (You can move around just untill half of the screen)
Space - Fire

I would probably abandon this project (at least for few weeks), got bored of it pretty quickly + bevy engine is great, but still very new and lacks a lot of features
